## About

The **Conversational Environment for Learning Languages**, or **CELL** for short, is a chatbot that allows the user to converse and play different games in different languages. All features take place in a seamless and natural conversation that can be viewed on a desktop, laptop or mobile device.

## How To View The Project

The CELL Project is currently being hosted online, and can be viewed and utilized [here](#). <INSERT LINK>

## How To Host The Project Locally

Since CELL works off the Node.js framework, it can be easily hosted locally on your computer if you wish to do so.

**Step 1:** Download the CELL Project

This can be done in a variety of ways. You could simply download all the files, use Git to clone the respository directly, or even clone it to some IDE. The project even has a .PROJECT file, so it should be recognized by Eclipse (no IDE is necessary though).

**Step 2:** Download & Install Node.js & NPM

You can do so by downloading the Windows or Mac version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js and NPM come bundled together, so it's one simple download. Run the file downloaded in order to install it.

**Step 3:** Install Nodemon

With your command prompt or terminal, navigate to wherever your CELL project is located. You should be able to see all the files as they are shown in this repository. Use the following command to install Nodemon:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

**Step 4:** Run Nodemon

Now that everything is setup, with your command prompt still in your CELL directory, use the following command to start your locally hosted version of CELL:

```
nodemon start
```

With that, the CELL project will be running solely for your machine on your local address:

```
127.0.0.1:3000
```
